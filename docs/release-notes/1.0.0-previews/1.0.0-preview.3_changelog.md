# TaylorBot Release Notes 📝
`v1.0.0-preview.3` - `2018.04.28` ⭐

- Redesigned commands now with embed flavor! 🍧
    - **ServerInfo** command! Now displays online count and channels count correctly! ✅

- New Accessible Roles system! 😱
    - Moderators can mark specific roles as "accessible" by using the **SetAccessibleRole** command. ⚔
    - Users can use the **GetRole** command to get a role that is accessible. 🕊

- Thanks to EnchantedLuna, we were able to retrieve join dates for some users in the r/TaylorSwift server! 📅
    - These join dates are not completely accurate, they are either based on the FearlessBot welcoming message or the first message of the user. ⚠
    - If you have proof that you joined earlier than what your join date suggests, please provide it! 🕵🏻️‍
    - This will cause the ranking on the Joined command to be a little more accurate. 🐛

- Lots of major improvements and fixes. 📈
