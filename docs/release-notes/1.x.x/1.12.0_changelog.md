# TaylorBot Release Notes 📝
`v1.12.0` - `2021.06.05` ⭐

- As the moderation team of a server, did you ever want to establish a better communication channel with specific users? Introducing **Mod Mail**! 📮
    - Make sure you have enabled moderation command usage logging with **/mod log set** so your team can see what other moderators are doing. 👀
    - As a moderator, use **/mod mail message-user** to send a direct message to a user. The user's DM settings need to allow TaylorBot to send messages to them. 📧
    - The user won't see who exactly wrote the message, only that it's coming from your moderation team. As an example, you could use this to send warnings to members without singling out a moderator as responsible. 👨‍👨‍👧‍👧
    - Server members can send also send messages to the moderation team using **/mod mail message-mods**. Messages will be relayed (not anonymous) to the moderation log channel of the server. 📬
    - As a moderator, you can prevent specific users from sending mod mail with **/mod mail block** and undo with **/mod mail unblock**. This can be useful if a specific user is spamming your mod mail. ❌

- **/kick** now asks for confirmation when kicking users that have been on the server for 30 days or more. ❓

- Fixed an issue where the bot could stop responding entirely for a significant period of time under certain circumstances. 🐛

- Fixed an issue where **/kick** would sometimes respond with unknown command errors. 🐛

- Fixed an issue where **ChannelInfo** would not respond when used with a stage channel. 🐛

- Lots of minor improvements and fixes. 📈
