# TaylorBot Release Notes 📝
`v1.8.0` - `2020.09.18` ⭐

- Revamped accessible **Roles** commands! 🆔
    - Most servers have roles that you want everyone to have access to, this is the perfect use case for accessible roles! They've been available in TaylorBot for a while, but with this update they're becoming more user friendly and powerful! 💪
    - Use **Roles** to see what accessible roles are available in the current server! 🔎
    - Use **Roles** with the role name to grab one of them (**GR** shortcut is kept for compatibility)! 🖐
    - Use **Roles Drop** with the role name to drop an accessible role you already have! 🙅‍♂️
    - Use **Roles Add** to set a role as accessible in the current server! ➕
    - Use **Roles Remove** to unset a role as accessible in the current server! ➖
    - Use **Roles Group** with a group name and a role name to group accessible roles together. When roles are grouped, users can only get one role of a group at the same time. 👨‍👩‍👦‍👦

- New **TaypointWill** command to see someone's will (including yourself)! 👀
    - All **TaypointWill** commands now show usernames instead of just mentions! 🙏

- Add more aliases for Last.fm periods such as "1week", "90day", "180day", "365day" and "alltime". 📙

- Fixed an issue where some **LastFm** commands would display an unknown error on very long album/artist/track titles. 🐛

- Fixed an issue where **List Birthdays** would display an unknown error when a user in the server had their birthday set to February 29th. 🐛

- Fixed an issue where deprecated **SetAge** returned an error on some inputs, leading to confusion. 🐛

- Fixed an issue where some commands would not pick the best match when searching a user by username. 🐛

- Lots of minor improvements and fixes. 📈
