# TaylorBot Release Notes 📝
`v1.8.2` - `2020.12.01` ⭐

- The **Status** command is disabled for the foreseeable future. Unfortunately, new Discord restrictions to protect data privacy make status information not available to large bots like TaylorBot by default. After some back and forth with Discord, they don't consider the **Status** command as an acceptable use case to get access to this data. If you used this command mainly to show off Spotify's "Now Playing", you'll have to use **LastFm** instead. 😕

- Fixed an issue where the Folklore heist bank was not available. 🐛

- Fixed an issue where some commands would not respond when mentioning a channel from another server. 🐛

- Lots of minor improvements and fixes. 📈
