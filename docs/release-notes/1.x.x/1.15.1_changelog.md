# TaylorBot Release Notes 📝
`v1.15.1` - `2021.11.14` ⭐

- TaylorBot now has a [Privacy Policy](https://privacy.taylorbot.app/)! Nothing changed, it's just putting into words how I deal with data privacy and transparency! 📃

- Moved command enabling/disabling to slash commands! 👉
    - **DisableServerCommand**/**EnableServerCommand** are now **/command server-disable** and **/command server-enable**. ⛔
    - **DisableChannelCommand**/**EnableChannelCommand** are now **/command channel-disable** and **/command channel-enable**. ⛔
    - Fixed an issue where you had to use the disable command in the same channel you were disabling the command in. 🐛
    - Discord is working on improving slash command control for server managers, but until then these commands are still useful for both prefix and slash commands. 🔮

- Lots of minor improvements and fixes. 📈
