- Added new **/poll** command! 🗳️
    - You can input a title and up to 4 options in a modal window ✍️
    - Users in the current channel can vote using buttons and see live results being updated 📊
    - For now, this command is available alongside prefixed **Poll** and **ReactPoll** 🤹

- Deleted messages monitoring now also logs message reactions being removed 👁️
    - This is useful to spot users that quickly add and remove problematic reactions 🙅‍♂️
