# TaylorBot Release Notes 📝
`v1.13.0` - `2021.07.05` ⭐

- **Reminders** have been revamped and turned into slash commands! ⚡
    - Add a reminder with **/remind add**. Pick how long from now you want to be reminded at (i.e. `3h` for 3 hours). Assuming your DM settings allow it, you'll receive a DM from TaylorBot to remind you. ⏰
    - You can have at most **2** reminders active at the same time. TaylorBot Plus members can have up to **4**. 🧱
    - You can see your active reminders and delete them using **/remind manage**. 📃
    - Prefixed reminder commands can't be used anymore. 🧓

- Search for YouTube videos using the new **/youtube** command! 🎥
    - The command now uses buttons that appear instantly instead of reactions! 🔘
    - The slash command is limited to **7** uses per day. The prefixed **YouTube** command can still be used, but will be limited to **3** uses per day. ⛔

- Message and word counting is no longer immediate. The counts will be updated periodically every few minutes. 🧮
    - This should fix an issue where random command errors could occur when there were a lot of message sent at the same time. 🐛

- Threads are soon coming to Discord! This feature requires some changes in bots and not all features will work properly from the get go. 🥨
    - For now, only TaylorBot slash commands will work in threads. Prefixed commands won't get a response from TaylorBot. 😕
    - TaylorBot won't count messages, words and minutes for messages sent in threads. Deleted messages from threads will not be logged. 😕
    - Some big changes are required to make these features work in threads, hopefully they will be added in future TaylorBot updates. 🔜

- Lots of minor improvements and fixes. 📈
