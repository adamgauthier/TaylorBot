# TaylorBot Release Notes 📝
`v1.10.1` - `2021.04.15` ⭐

- The **Avatar** command is the first TaylorBot command that can be used as a __Slash Command__. 🤩
    - Slash Commands are a new Discord feature that makes it easier to use commands directly in Discord. No more typos in the command format or forgetting the server prefix! 👋
    - Try out this new experience by typing `/avatar` and notice the command description and parameters are displayed in real time. 📖
    - There are things to improve so test it out and report any bugs! 📮
    - The regular prefix command can still be used for now! 🧓
    - This is the first step to TaylorBot Slash Commands but expect to see them more and more in the coming months! 📆

- Fixed an issue where the "disabled command" message wouldn't always be displayed for ambiguous commands when only one of them was disabled. 🐛

- Lots of minor improvements and fixes. 📈
