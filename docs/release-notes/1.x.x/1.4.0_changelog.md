    - "Member" type logs include user joining, leaving, getting banned and unbanned. 📜
    - Use the **AddLogChannel** and **RemoveLogChannel** to control what channel the bot logs in. It can be the same one for both! 🕵🏼‍♂️

- Major optimization and stability improvements have been made in this update to mitigate issues leading to the bot going offline for longer than it should. ⚡
    - As the number of servers TaylorBot is in has increased past 150, it's something I've been working hard to fix. 🤖

- Small amount of points is now rewarded on 420 with the **Roll** command! 🍃

- The **Avatar** command has been moved to a new experimental command module! 🧪
    - The search by username of this command should be more accurate. 🔍
    - Some features like help currently aren't working for this new module. 🔜

- **CleverBot** command has been removed. ⚰
    - With the underlying API being so unreliable, the user experience of the command is bad and so it's better to not have it at all. 😕
    - You can now ping the bot to run a command without knowing the server prefix. ❕

- Fixed a bug causing the YouTube post notification links to link to a non-existing page. 🐛

- Fixed a bug where it was possible to mess up formatting of **List** and **Rank** commands with specific syntax in username or attributes. 🐛

- Fixed a bug where a rare occurrence could lead to two **DailyPayout** rewards being awarded on the same day. 🐛
