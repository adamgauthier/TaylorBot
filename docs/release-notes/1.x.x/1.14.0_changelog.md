# TaylorBot Release Notes 📝
`v1.14.0` - `2021.07.30` ⭐

- Did you lose a high daily streak you cared about? You can now re-buy your lost highest streak with **/daily rebuy**! 😱
    - This operation will cost you **50 taypoints per day** of the streak you're restoring. 💸

- Claim your daily streak using the new **/daily claim** command! 👷‍♂️
    - For a limited time, use this command to get **60 taypoints per day** instead of the usual 50. 🤑

- Search for images using the new **/image** command! 📷
    - The command now uses buttons that appear instantly instead of reactions! 🔘
    - The slash command is limited to **4** uses per day or **7** uses per day for TaylorBot Plus members. The prefixed **Image** command can still be used, but will be limited to **3** uses per day. ⛔

- Deleted logs now support uncached "user joined the server" system messages. 🚮

- Deleted logs now use Discord markdown relative timestamp rendering for the "Sent At" and "Edited At" metadata. 📆

- Buttons are now removed from messages when TaylorBot stops listening to them to avoid confusing "interaction failed" errors. ⌚

- The **/remind add** command now supports combined time formats such as "1d 7h". ⏰

- Fixed an issue where some prefix commands did not respond in announcement channels. 🐛

- Lots of minor improvements and fixes. 📈
