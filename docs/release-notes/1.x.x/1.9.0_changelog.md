# TaylorBot Release Notes 📝
`v1.9.0` - `2021.01.18` ⭐

- Had an embarrassing old username you don't want people to see? It is now possible to use the **Usernames Private** and **Usernames Public** commands to configure the privacy of your username history on TaylorBot. When set to private, your username history won't be shown when users use the **Usernames** command for you. Changing this setting keeps your username history hidden, but keep in mind it might still be possible for someone to find your old usernames through Discord search, for example. 🏷️

- Get 20 or more users to **Heist** together to rob the newly added Evermore Federal Reserve! 🏦

- The **YouTube** command is now restricted to 10 uses per user per day. 🚦

- Fixed an issue where an unknown command error would occur when TaylorBot tried to give an accessible role that is higher in the hierarchy. 🐛

- Fixed an issue that caused **UserInfo** to be missing the username header. 🐛

- Lots of minor improvements and fixes. 📈
