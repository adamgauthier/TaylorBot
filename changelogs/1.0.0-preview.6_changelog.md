# TaylorBot Release Notes 📝
`v1.0.0-preview.6` - `2018.06.23` ⭐

- New **Reminders** system! ⚠
    - **RemindMe** command!
        - Use it to add a reminder, you can now have up to *3* at the same time! 😱
    - **ClearReminders** command! This will clear all your current reminders 😌

- Added **RandomUserInfo** command, as some users (like Bianca - <@162503775502729226>) wanted the old functionality back. 🎲
    - Keep in mind that this *won't* provide a random user amongst *all* server members, as it uses the bot's cache. 🔢 

- Added **BotInfo** command! This command provides info about the bot's version and cache. 🤖

- Added **Image** command! Use it to search pictures on Google Images! 🖼
    - This command has been ported quickly to help avoid limit breaking, but it will get updates in the future! 🔮
    - Note: searching with `imaget` *won't* provide taylor swift related results. 🚫

- Fixed an issue that would cause commands not to find a user when there were more than 1 space before the mention 🐛 (thanks Teleqraph - @<98862866735583232>!)

- Lots of minor improvements and fixes. 📈
